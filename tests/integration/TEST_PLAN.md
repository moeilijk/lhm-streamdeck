# Integration test plan

Each test deletes any leftover slots first, creates new tiles, tests the feature, then removes everything.

### test-global-thresholds.js — keys 0–3

**New tiles:** settings (0), reading temp (1), reading load (2), reading suppress (3)
- Mock source profile configured; tiles set to CPU Package / CPU Total / CPU Package

**On:** add global threshold "HighTemp", ReadingType=Temp, operator=>, value=80, enabled=true

**Test (10 assertions):**
1a. Sensor at 45°C → no active threshold on temp tile
1b. Sensor raised to 90°C → global threshold active on temp tile
2.  Load at 90% → no active threshold on load tile (type filter)
3a. Suppress global on suppress tile, sensor at 90°C → suppress tile does not fire
3b. Temp tile (not suppressed) fires during same period
4.  Unsuppress suppress tile → fires again
5a. CPU Package reading received with raw type "Temperature"
5b. Mapped type "Temp" matches global readingType "Temp" — no "None match"
5c. CPU Total maps to "Usage", correctly excluded from Temp global
5d. All LHM type strings map correctly (Voltage→Volt, Load→Usage, etc.)

**Off:** global threshold deleted, mock reset, all 4 tiles deleted

### test-derived-thresholds.js — keys 30–32

**New tiles:** settings (30), derived (31), reference reading (32)
- Mock source profile configured

- Reference reading tile: CPU Package

**On:** add global threshold "AllTypesHigh", readingType="" (all types), operator=>, value=80

**Test (7 assertions):**
1a. Sensors at 45°C/42°C (avg ~43.5°C) → derived tile not active
1b. Both sensors raised to 90°C → global threshold active on derived tile
1c. Global threshold also fires on reference reading tile
2a. Suppress global on derived tile; sensors at 90°C → derived tile does not fire
2b. Reference tile still fires while derived is suppressed
3.  Unsuppress derived tile; sensors still at 90°C → derived tile fires again
4.  smoothingAlpha=0.4, updateIntervalOverrideMs=2500, graphHeightPct=70, graphLineThickness=2, textStroke=true on derived tile → all persisted

**Off:** global threshold deleted, mock reset, all 3 tiles deleted

### test-composite-global-suppress.js — keys 40–42

**New tiles:** settings (40), composite (41), reference reading (42)

**On:** add global threshold "TempHigh", ReadingType=Temp, operator=>, value=80

**Test (5 assertions):**
1a. Sensor at 45°C → composite slot 0 not active
1b. Sensor at 90°C → global threshold active on composite slot 0
2a. Suppress global on composite slot 0; sensor at 90°C → slot 0 does not fire
2b. Reference reading tile (not suppressed) still fires
3.  Unsuppress composite slot 0; sensors still at 90°C → slot 0 fires again

2.  Update: name="Test Profile", host=192.168.1.99, port=8090 → persisted
3a. Set new profile as default → defaultSourceProfileId updated in plugin
3b. defaultSourceProfileId persisted to global settings file
4a. Restore original default; delete new profile → profile removed from list
4b. Profile count back to initial

**Off:** original default restored, new profile deleted, mock reset, settings tile deleted

## Hardware test — #48 Linux hwmon (manual, native Linux only)

DeckBridge on WSL runs the Windows binary; the hwmon code path requires native Linux with a real Stream Deck.

**New tiles:** settings, reading

**On:** add source profile with host empty or 127.0.0.1, set as default
- Expected: sensors from /sys/class/hwmon visible without lhm-companion running

**Test:**
- Configure reading tile with a hwmon sensor (e.g. CPU Package temperature)
- Set a threshold → verify it fires on overshoot
- Set EMA smoothing → verify value is smooth

**Off:** change source profile host to a remote address (e.g. 192.168.x.x:8085)
- Expected: plugin switches to HTTP polling, hwmon no longer active
- Expected: tile shows disconnected until lhm-companion is reachable at that address
- Delete the local profile, restore original default, delete tiles
